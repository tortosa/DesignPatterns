Below you'll find a mess of classes and interfaces for an action adventure game. 

You'll find classes for game characters along with classes for weapon behaviours the characters can use in the game. 

Each character can make use of one weapon at a time, but can change weapons at any time during the game. Your job is sort it all out..

1. Arrange the clases
2. Identify one abstract class, one interface and eight classes.
3. Draw arrows between classes.
	a. inheritance / extends (arrow with solid line, white body)
	b. interface / implements (arrow with points line, white body)
	c. HAS-A (arrow with solid line and solid body)
4. Put the method setWeapon() into the right class
